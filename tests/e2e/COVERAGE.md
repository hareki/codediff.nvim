# Refresh E2E coverage against main

Baseline: `main` / `origin/main` at
`4b3ad7eb99dd0f02e64bbaf562ca1e87e8c07cc9`.

This audit covers the refresh implementation, its session-data refactor, and
regressions found while expanding the tests. Paths below are relative to
`lua/codediff/`. Deleted modules are mapped to their replacement behavior rather
than tested through compatibility adapters.

## Fixture and observation contract

All Git-backed tests use `tests/support/repository.lua`, including callers of
`require("tests.support").create_temp_git_repo`. The richer UI scenarios share
`tests/fixtures/refresh_repo.lua`. Each case owns a temporary repository and
worktree; cases never share mutable refs, indexes or object files. See
[the fixture documentation](../fixtures/README.md).

The tests start an actual `nvim --embed`, issue commands or keyboard/mouse input,
and observe rendered screen cells. Git operations affect a real repository.
Native cases require the real watcher to become ready. Polling cases explicitly
disable the native transport and exercise the 500 ms fallback. No test replaces
notifications with a call to an internal refresh method.

Race cases delay delivery of **real Git results**, without replacing their
contents. The read-error case temporarily removes a real loose Git object.
Index-only changes are written directly to Git objects/index entries, without
exposing an unintended intermediate working-tree state. Literal-arrow path
cases keep entries in the real index with skip-worktree, allowing Windows to
exercise the same status parsing without trying to create an illegal `>` filename.
Dialog cases answer Neovim's actual confirmation prompt. Expected file contents,
Git blobs, paths, colors and navigation destinations come from the fixture or
Git, not production diff/gutter calculators.

The existing hand-authored gutter shape tests remain component-level screen
checks. They deliberately use synthetic buffers to test visual projections that
are difficult to express through a Git merge. They are not counted below.

## Scenario matrix

A named scenario is distinct from its parameterized executions. The matrix has
133 named scenarios and 548 E2E executions on a platform with a native watcher.
This is the refresh change-audit matrix, not the entire E2E suite. Other command,
working-file and diagnostic E2Es are additional coverage. Fixture self-tests,
unit tests and component integrations are not included in these counts.

## New scenario index

Each ID is part of the test name, making failures and source searches traceable.

| IDs | Contract |
| --- | --- |
| H01–H03 | Stage one/all hunks, unstage one, preserve unaffected index/working text |
| H04–H07 | Real discard/cancel dialogs, deleted lines, BOF insertions |
| H08–H10 | Diffget, undo/redo/save, layout-specific diffput, staging unsaved text |
| H11–H14 | Layout toggle, compact folds, manual-only refresh, hunk text object |
| E01–E04 | Panel/pane staging, same-group advancement, gS, stage/unstage all |
| E05–E08 | Directory staging/restoration, cancel, untracked deletion |
| E09–E13 | Group visibility, folds, list/tree, auto-open, hidden panels, filters/pathspec |
| E14–E16 | Staged rename, deleted-file return, customized mappings after buffer replacement |
| E17–E20 | Rendered hover path, tree navigation, gf/tab return, real double-click |
| Y01–Y05 | Latest/older commits, lazy files, added/deleted previews, list/tree preservation |
| Y06–Y10 | HEAD refresh, root commit, movable base tag, collapse preservation, filtering |
| Y11–Y14 | Rename paths, layout changes, line-range filtering, reverse ordering |
| C01–C05 | Independent fixture seed, marker cells/colors, per-block resolution, undo/redo/discard |
| C06–C11 | Whole-file resolution/reset and numbered diffget |
| C12–C15 | Conflict navigation, save, unrelated staging, quit dialogs, finish-and-stage workflow |
| S01–S05 | Unicode/BOM/CRLF, virtual syntax/readonly, no final newline, empty files |
| S06–S10 | Renames, fixed ancestry, movable tags, regular Git directories, SHA-256 |
| S11–S14 | Plain paths with spaces/Unicode, literal arrows, renamed arrows, unborn branches |
| S15–S19 | Whitespace policy, whole-file highlights, original-right layout, moves, --repo |
| T09–T12 | Hidden updates, hidden wipe, pane close, actual missing-object read/retry |
| T13–T16 | Leaving/returning to Git, user keymaps, inlay hints, shared buffers across tabs |
| T17 | Real Git reads slower than the polling interval still settle and publish the correct inputs |
| V01–V04 | Public revision URI, write protection, reversed load completions, wipe, missing file |

The existing 38 scenarios cover unchanged-status worktree changes, unsaved
buffers, mutable index/refs/HEAD, fixed revisions, added/deleted previews,
unchanged grids, directory scans, editable Result protection, missing merge
stages, late Git callbacks, tab/buffer retirement, cross-repository following,
hidden panels, shared subscriptions and native-process failover.

## Regressions found by the expanded scenarios

| Cases | Correction |
| --- | --- |
| E15 | Read a clean, previously missing file when it reappears instead of blocking on W13 |
| S02 | Populate inline revision buffers without firing FileType/LSP attachment |
| S06, S12–S13 | Parse raw NUL-delimited status paths; use the renamed index path for unstaged content |
| Y07, Y14 | Handle parentless history commits and list their files |
| Y13–Y14 | Preserve line-range and reverse query options during history refresh |
| T13 | Materialize a genuinely empty comparison side when following a file outside Git |
| T15–T16 | Retain original buffer settings and respect buffers still owned by another session |
| T17 | Coalesce fallback samples while input reads are running, without dropping actual invalidations |

## Scope of the assurance

This is a behavioral change map, not a claim of 100% line/branch coverage or an
exhaustive Cartesian product of every option. Tests validate Neovim's rendered
cells, not fonts or pixels. FileType/readonly/diagnostic/inlay contracts are
covered; every external LSP server, distribution, filesystem failure, and
third-party UI plugin is not installed or simulated. OS/version results must be
reported separately. A passing matrix is evidence for these contracts, not an
absolute guarantee that no other bug exists.
